I'm not a huge runner, but for the past 10 years have always bought running shoes as my everyday athletic shoes as I love the comfort of them.10 years ago I made a switch over to New Balance shoes and was hooked on them.  Only problem is that over the past year I have been walking to and from work in NYC almost every day logging about 3 miles in them daily.  As many of you probably know NYC is the best place to tear apart your shoes of any type. My last two pairs of New Balance only lasted about a year, and we starting to feel a bit heavy and clunky.  I had been reading great reviews about the Nike sneakers, and literally picked up a pair at a store one day and was surprised at how lightweight they were.I decided to give them a try, and so far (3 weeks) I am very happy with them.  They are extremely light weight, very breathable (they don't make my feet sweat, which I can have a problem with in many shoes), and very comfortable to walk in.  My wife picked these up for me while I was at work, and I was worried that the size 13 would either be too big, or too small (leaning on the too small size since a lot of people were talking about that), however, I would have to say these are a true to size 13.I'll check in to update my review in a few months, but so far these are amazing!The only thing I changed up with the shoes was swapped out the red laces for black laces.  Makes the shoes a little bit more subdued, however the red tongue still has some pop!Excellent buy, especially for the price!", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Amazing Walking shoe!

She generally likes it.Here's what she likes:1.  It has a robust band with plenty of adjustment options.  That keeps the watch stable when she is running, riding or swimming.  It is also very comfortable and, other than pinching her the first time she put it on, has been a breeze to work with.2.  It looks cool.  The combination of leathery (not real leather) black band and shiny metal casing is nice looking.3.  The numbers are big.  Makes it easier to read.  Somewhat makes up for drawback 1.What she doesn't like:1.  The display is a bit dark.  In situations with lots of light she has to hold it at a specific angle to be able to view the display.  You can always press the light button to make the display brighter but that takes two hands and takes away the option to \"glance\" at your watch.2.  It doesn't display seconds.  When she is doing planks and whatnot she likes to be able to time the exercise in seconds.  Although I pointed out it has a stopwatch that would involve figuring out how the stopwatch works which she doesn't feel like doing.Couple of other notes:1.  The watch is larger than most women's watches.  If you are, or are buying for, a delicate flower with tiny wrists and wispy jewelry then this watch may look out of place.2.  The band is not your typical \"belt\" style band.  It is more like a synthetic leather version of a metal clasp band and has a unique closure.3.  The last Nike brand watch I bought her (for which this is a replacement) lasted only 9 months before the band detached from the watch body.  If this watch fails similarly, then I will swear off Nike watches in the future.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Nice Watch", "unixReviewTime": 1208563200, "reviewTime": "04 19, 2008"}

But... I didn't expect the clasp to be like it was. It's not your typical clasp. It kinda flaps over and snaps shut. There are a lot of size adjustments but it still doesn't seem to fit me right. It's either too snug or too loose. I wear it too loose and it sits sideways on my wrist. I always have to pull it or shimmy it back the right way to read the time. The buttons on the sides are sunken in and hard to push. The only thing i can get on the watch are the time (with no seconds) and the date. Although when you push the date button you have to wait for it to say \"date\" for a couple seconds then it'll display the date. Same for back to the time. It'll say \"time\" for a few seconds until it will actually get back to the time.  I believe i've read somewhere that it does more than just have the date and time it but the watch is so complicated i don't want to take the time to figure it out.

I play Community College Basketball In Oregon not saying anything by that but I do have some experience with basketball shoes. These right here are some of the best shoes you can find and wear. If you do not care about the shoes you buy as a player then you should not be playing the game in my opinion but we all have are own.Okay so the 5 ProsLight And CompactOkay these shoes come out to be 10.6 ounces not the lightest shoes on the market but they are light and very stable for your foot. The design of the shoe is unlike most on the market today with its new technology and design to help support your foot. The Low-Top design is built for people with quick movements and for players that need to get to one point to another in a quick fashion. Kind of like Kevin Durant in a way. These will definitely help you improve your quickness if you are a guard messing with those high tops. I have worn these for awhile and have not had any ankle problems but I do wear ankle braces for support.StyleNot Much to say on this the sleek style of the shoe is beautiful. The half over the sole is not common in most shoes and what stands out about these shoes. The material is light again and comes in a variety of colors. Its Nike brand insures that you are getting top quality for the price you pay. As a basketball player we all know style gives us confidence on the court. Look Good you Play Good. So customize these if you do end up getting a pair. Do not be stuck with looking the same as other people on the court pleaze!Support:These shoes do not hug against your foot but fit for a snug support around your foot. I have worn these for awhile and have not had any blisters bumps on the bottom or sides of my feet. But when you do wear these for the first time walk around the house and break them in before you run out on the basketball court showing your new shoes. Players go and buy brand new shoes without breaking them in before they start playing then complain about how their foot got all blistered its because you did not break them in. The mold in side of the shoes mold to your exact foot structure and size. The structure is molded perfect so that you can have that quick bounce but also that support around your foot which is key.Price:You are not paying to much for these shoes! These are top of the line shoes and if you want top of the line performance then do not go and get your shoes at big 5. Go out and buy a quality basketball shoe and even if they are not KD's buy a shoe that has been on the market for awhile and that is reliable. These shoes are perfect for what they bring to the table when you are playing. The comfort, durability, style, and performance is right for the price of these shoes.The Player Kevin Durant:If you are a person who watches and loves the game of basketball. Kevin Durant is a class A person whether you appreciate him as a player or not. He conducts himself in not only a professional way but a role model for young and old players and spectators across the country. He is a class A person who would not release a shoe that was not reliable plain and simple. He wants his shoes to work and fit comfortable for all players just like his shoes fit him in games.

I was very satisfied with that sandal and wanted to purchase a similar Nike sandal. First of all after opening the box and trying on these sandals I discovered that this sandal is at least 1/2-1 size small, i.e. I ordered a mens' size 11, my actual foot size is exactly 10.5, and this sandal just barely fits with no exposed edge left whatsoever in the entire sandal (and I'm close to my ideal body weight, not overweight at all). Next it's made of a comparatively thinner polymer material that provides minimal cushioning to absorb shocks. My older sandal had a much thicker sole with a thick tread pattern for non-slip walking, and had a form fitted arch so that my foot neatly fitted into it without slipping when walking, etc. This sandal has none of those good design properties: its sole is much thinner in comparison with minimal arch support; and the tread pattern is comprised of relatively small ridges that do not appear to be thick enough to prevent slipping on wet hard surfaces.Also as another reviewer mentioned the underside of the front support is a fabric-like material that absorbs moisture like crazy so no wonder he said they smelled \"funky\" after a short time..this material if it stays wet is expected to be subject to mold growth.Btm line: save your $ and don't buy this sandal, especially if you've owned similar older Nike sandals.

I am a size 7 in Women's and went ahead and ordered the size 6 in men's. I have no complaints because I appreciate the extra half inch my toes now have. The fit was a little tight but within about 20 minutes of wearing they stretched to become quite comfortable.

They do require a wear in period (about 3 days of solid wear), and the leather softens up to your foot and from that point on they are super comfortable.  No more headaches at the end of the day from the impact my feet take running about the ship and they breathe really well so my feet don't stink either.  Great purchase and I'm glad I got them.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "The greatest shoe for my work.", "unixReviewTime": 1372032000, "reviewTime": "06 24, 2013"}

There was one little flaw. instead of tossing the pair nike finds somewhere to sell it besides one of there stores such as this amazon seller. The shoes fit fine there are no flaws to prove that they are replicas (fakes) but there is a clear flaw that is just a factory mistake by nike. I would post a picture if i could and you would see what i mean. When the shoes are on your feet and you look down at them right where the tip of the nike swoosh is (side closest to the toe of the shoe) there is a kind of curve in the charcol part that follows the curv. on one shoe the curv is perfect and pointed at the end like the nike swoosh but on the other shoe it is rounded and dosent have that same point. it is just a clear poor mistake by nike because if they were replicas these would be the best replicas ever made. Besides that they are some cool kicks but i wouldnt pay the full price for them if they are B grades. I would suggest buying them elsewhere. I am the only one who notices it but i feel like i was cheated of some of the money i spent on them. there very comfortable and i will still wear them till they wear out. you could still buy them but fully inspect the shoe before wearing them because once u wear them u are stuck with them they can not be refunded.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Fine but one flaw!! read this before purchase IMPORTANT!", "unixReviewTime": 1379548800, "reviewTime": "09 19, 2013"}

I plan on using them for everyday and gym work such as treadmill and squats.  They are cushy how I like for squats.  The thing I don't like it that the tongue is nylon.  I hate the Cortez nylons as they are cheesy and prefer my shoes to be leather as they last longer look better and are more comfy better made.  Nylon is just a cheap material so I avoid it as much as possible as a rule.  Nike made these Cortez cheaper than their other Cortez.  Cortez is like a tough shoe like Lugz.  Now Nike makes weird shoes with silly colors so harder to get a decent shoe out of them.  I have been looking for the Cortez blue suedes for a long time like four years and have not been able to find them, only the leathers and nylons and this one is a cross of both so that is disappointing.  I wanted to put fat laces on these but with the cheapo nylon inside that seems silly.  Who puts fat laces on nylons?  I probably will but leather tongue is more comfortable plus I plan on running a lot on these and leather is not as absorbent as nylon.  The nylon is going to get funky quick with my demanding workouts.  I guess I'm better off with track Asics and Adidas as it seems Nike is lowering their quality putting brand recognition over quality materials and construction.  Nike leather is cheap and thin and then they try to piece pleather of fabric in places to be even cheaper.  They are too greedy and as a result they are hurting their brand.

The Nike air max 2013, these shoes are the running shoes you see everybody wearing. Ads call them the new hot swagger if super stars got them why don't you. So many people fall for these Ads, but me ii think this product has a problem with it time span, all the different color, there's so many more problem with the shoe. The product has some good qualities but the shoe its self is just ugly for the price there sold for in all stores. These shoes are over priced at $200 a pair. This is my negative review about this product \"THE PRICE\".The prices for the Nike air max 2013 I think are overpriced. Why they cost so much is because of the product description, the Nike air max 2013 running shoes are the most flexible of its kind. People say when they go running the shoe is so flexible it fills as if there were no shoes on their feet. The shoe is so lightweight its 1.5 weight makes it fill as if you could run forever. I also think the prices for the Nike air max cost so much money is because of how comfortable the shoe is to the users.The shoe immediately out of the box looked cheap and seemed poorly made. The style of the shoe looks like it's not made to least still it's one of the best of its kind. People all over the world buys the Nike air max 2013 for running and running only it's understandable why, the shoe is great for running but the shoe is way too ugly to cost over $200. I think people would buy this shoe just cause of the ethos super stars put on about the shoe, cause to me the shoe is not all that great but like I said the shoe do have good quality use for athletes of all kind.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "What's so good about them!", "unixReviewTime": 1359936000, "reviewTime": "02 4, 2013"}

Something about walking on a bubble of air always fascinated me. But this year I think Nike missed the mark. The most obvious change is to the tongue of the shoe. Or whatever this thing is called. It's extremely thin made of some type of nylon. Reminds me of the same material rain jackets are made of. It's so thin I have doubts it will last very long. Its like a flap of fabric, no cushion to it at all. The tongue is so thin and small that I have a hard time grabbing the thing when pulling them on me feet.  I typically buy new Nike once a year. But the feel of these shoes does not instill confidence in me that they will make the entire year. Maybe it's just me. But I feel prior versions were made of better material. I will keep them simply because I need new shoes. But if I had seen these in the store before I made my purchase online, I probably would have chosen a different year model. Don't get me wrong, they are still Nike Air max. And if you wear Nike as much as I wear Nike,  then they will do just fine.

Hyett \"dai-fish\"", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "I've been a keen runner for almost 4 years now and throughout this time I've always worn Nike running shoes, mainly because of the quality fit I always seem to get when trying on Nike shoes. All my running is done on paved or termac surfaces so I've always opted for the more cushioned pegasus or lunarglide shoe. Whilst browsing online one day I saw these for 45 and decided to take a gamble (I was aware they were much less cushioned than my usual shoe).After running approx 20 miles in the first week wearing these I was a little concerned that my legs felt a little more fatigued than usual, but this sensation soon abated after a few more runs. The striking thing about these Nikes once you run them in is how natural they feel on your feet, they are so light and comfortable and give just enough feedback unlike my last pair of pegasus which felt bouncy and unstable.

In the past, I've been obsessed with Borns, but the newer ones haven't been as comfy. I love the Crocs Patricia II for wearing out (comfortable, good arch support, and stylish), but needed something for just around the house. I first tried the Nike Comfort Slide, but they sent me the wrong color and when I tried it on the foam was uncomfortable and didn't give my arch any support. Then I tried the Crocs Meleen, but the footbed nubs were really sharp and not soft like the Patricia II. Also the high upper strap was tight on my slender boney foot and I found it painful. It also cut off circulation to my feet and left them numb feeling. Since I have slender feet, this hasn't happened with other shoes I've tried before. Finally I tried the Sanrah and found it to be very comfortable. It has soft footbed nubs like the Patricia II, good arch support, and a lower heel than the Patricia II, which I thought was better for around the house.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "3rd Pair the Charm, A review of several sandals - 1st Pair", "unixReviewTime": 1369699200, "reviewTime": "05 28, 2013"}

Length wise the shoes fit just fine. However, they felt narrow when I put them on. I have never needed nor have I ever purchased a pair of Nike shoes in a wide size. Initially, the sides of my feet were feeling crowded and pinched.The toe box area has adequate room though. The shoes did feel like they stretched after a couple of hours of wearing them around the house. Even still I was finding that the arch support was not comfortable. It felt like it was too far back on my foot, almost to my heel. I was not sold on the over all style of the shoe. The tongue of the shoe is integrated into the rest of the shoe, there is some stitching to show that this is the tongue area. Over all, I did not like the look of the shoe.

Gaspard \"Tina\"", "helpful": [41, 45], "reviewText": "I know the review title is kind of silly and maybe a bit provocative, but, it is just the plain truth! My feet are pretty much never happy. I have very high arches and could never get used to wearing orthotics, so, my feet perpetually crave a massage. When I started running a while back, this became even more of a problem. I bought a pair of shoes that were supposed to have a lot of support and cushioning (since I am a big girl), but they felt like anvils on my feet. I knew I needed a lighter shoe, but in most cases lighter means less cushion and support. For smaller, flat-footed people, those shoes work fine, but not me. I did a lot of research and tried a shoe that was supposed to be a sort of transitional shoe from the standard running shoe to barefoot running and also have a high arch. The shoes felt ok, and were certainly light, but I definitely felt the lack of support, stability and cushion and wound up with sore knees for hours after each run. So, I went back online, did tons more research and then headed to the sporting goods store to try on shoes. From the moment I put these shoes on and felt how they hugged my arches, I was in love. But, they are kind of minimal shoes and I was worried that they would also result in my suffering with sore knees or hips. Instead of buying these \"send my arches to heaven\" shoes, I did more research and compared the cushion, support and stability ratings with other more traditional shoes that were recommended for heavy runners. This shoe held it's own in pretty much every category...and it was a good 2-3 ounces lighter, too! Finally, I felt comfortable buying the shoes my arches fell in love with.I've since run in them several times and spent a day walking in them, too. They are, quite simply, the best shoes my feet have ever been in. I have never gotten that \"anvils for shoes\" feeling, and never had sore knees or hips. In fact, despite their low profile/thin sole, these shoes feel more supportive and cushioned than my other clunkers with a huge sole. I absolutely adore these shoes! But, I would caution anyone considering these shoes to do their homework, go to a local store to try them on and run around a bit in them. Everyone's feet are different and the extra step could save you from the disappointment, pain and hassle I had with my other running shoe purchase.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "\"No shoe ever touched me this way!\"", "unixReviewTime": 1373932800, "reviewTime": "07 16, 2013"}

Alas, those things get STINKY and never really seem to wash right. Plus, they look weird. So I've been on the hunt for shoes that make you feel like you're running wild and free but don't give your toes a squicky feeling or draw stares. These are those shoes. They do lack the &#34;I can feel the pavement through the soles of my feet!&#34; aspect, but that's really not a bad thing if you, like me, are actually running on pavement 99% of the time. They provide just enough cushion that my feet don't feel tortured at the end of a run, but they don't change my natural gait and honestly feel lighter than air. The cozy fit of the fabric around the ankle keeps stones and grit out. I did have some rubbing on my heel the first run that resulted in some mean blisters, but they haven't recurred.

The squeak is not generated by the outer sole and the floor surface (like when walking with wet shoes on a tile floor).  This squeak occurs even when walking on carpeting and appears to emanate from somewhere between the inner and outer layers of the sole in the area under the ball of your foot.  The squeak is prominent enough that not only can you hear it, but you can feel it.  The shoe actually vibrates under the ball of your foot with each step.  This is an extremely aggravating sensation and I find myself loosening the laces and slipping my feet out of them whenever possible.

The top, bottom and inside is very thick and strong as it should be.I've used this Nike brand 6 times so far for working out (about 45 minutes to an hour each time). So far they look and feel great. I didn't hear any squeaking as mentioned by other reviewers. The first use did feel snug or a bit tight. After that it just felt comfortable. That, to me, is a sign of a good well fitting sneaker. Another great thing is that they were almost $10 cheaper than in the local store. I would definitely buy these again in the future.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Goodbye New Balance hello Nike Air", "unixReviewTime": 1393200000, "reviewTime": "02 24, 2014"}

These are not the least-expensive pair of Nikes that I could have bought, but they \"feel\" like they are.I am not referring to the fact that they are light weight, which is a plus, but more to the overall appearance and feel. The soles feel very \"plastic-y\", and make more noise than what I am used to, or care for. The rest of the shoe just feels synthetic and cheaply made. If this is what passes for a reasonably priced pair of Nikes today, then I am pretty disappointed. If it is just this model, then I feel a bit deceived.On the plus side, they are reasonably comfortable, and have a good bit of cushion at the bottom of the foot (insole?), hence the third star.

The quality is gone.  I am sure that the material they are made of is by some definition \"leather\".  It feels and looks much more like plastic.  I doubt they would have held up through one winter and in terms of comfort and warmth they inspired very little confidence.  I returned them.  Why the 3 star review?  Honestly, my opinion is 1 star.  I have too much respect for my feet to ever put crap like these boots on them... but I do feel that part of that feeling stems from my own disappointment in the comparison to the boots I have.  That is not the fault of the boots I returned, so I gave them the benefit of the doubt.  I also can't verify the comfort or warmth factors... I never wore them.

I saw a review from a woman rating a mens shoe that plays raquetball in running shoes. It was also considered a favorite review. Very confusing how someone can rate a running shoe and have negative feed back to a runner who didn't like the shoe. I've logged well over 1000 miles in the +28s and had to switch to the +29s because I wore my last pair out. I thought this would be a safe change due to other pegasus' I've worn over the years. I am a month from running another marathon and realize this was probably not a good time to change shoees but I took a chance with the +29s. Unbelievable difference. At least to me. My knees and feet hurt so bad after a 19 mile run that I was having doubts as to wether I would actually be able to finish the marathon training. Luckily the local shoe store here helped me and I think I'll be ok. If you are used to the +28s just be careful with the +29s. Make sure you can return them if you need to. And really people, if your going to do things other than run in a running shoe, don't behigh and mighty over a person that didn't like the shoe and used it for its inended purpose...", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Big change from the +28s", "unixReviewTime": 1361750400, "reviewTime": "02 25, 2013"}

In my opinion, there is no better shoe for folks with a high arch who need a cushioning shoe.  With that all being said I still wanted to make sure about my purchase so I went to the Nike Factory store and tried 6 different neutral/cushioning shoes.  The only shoes I thought would cut it were the Nike Pegasus 29 and the Nike Icarus.  I went with the Pegasus because they had a great fit, felt very light on my feet, and seemed to have enough cushioning for support.

I was wearing dress shoes to work and working in NYC I'm on pavement all the time. I rarely walk on anything other than pavement and handling the NYC subway daily is a lot on your feet. Lots of stairs, lots of concrete. At the end of the day if your feet don't hurt you're doing something right, which I have to thank Nike Free Run for.Before I got these shoes my feet weren't getting enough cushion between my foot and the gravel. I was wearing dress shoes daily and frankly my feet were falling apart. I saw a doctor who told me that my arches had collapsed and I wasn't getting enough support from my dress shoes. I'm 25. He told me to get these hard inserts to put in my shoes. These weren't cushioned inserts, they were hard and stiff. They made the ground feel harder and made me even less comfortable than I had been before. That didn't make a lot of sense to me. Why would I want a nonflexible inserts to fix my flat feet? I tried the soft inserts as well, but obviously those soft inserts aren't re-engineering the shoes. My dress shoes still sucked, and the damage was done. My feet problems extended to my back and suddenly I'm 25 and miserable.Now it's not fair to compare dress shoes and sneakers. Obviously sneakers should be more comfortable and provide more support. But you have to understand, the damage had been done. I moved to sneakers and STILL COULDN'T WALK IN MOST OF THEM. I experimented with a few different sneakers. In converse shoes my foot pain started almost immediately. I tried some cheap sneakers and those were also useless. I also tried an expensive pair of Nike sneakers, and frankly, those didn't work either. Nothing provided support to the inside of my foot, they only created a cushion for the bottom of my feet. I have four or five pairs of sneakers that I wore maybe 5 or 6 times that are sitting in my closet never to be seen again.Enter Nike Free Run 5: These shoes are unlike most shoes and most sneakers because they're TIGHT, but they will eventually expand to fit your feet. They're tight but with lots of flexibility so the foot can do what it wants to do naturally, but the shoe gets right in there on the inside of the foot and lifted the portion of my wide feet that were prone to expanding. Again, my problem is flat feet. My arches were collapsing. This shoe LIFTS my arch and keeps it there. The shoe has those side strings that tighten the shoe around the sides of your feet, it's not just tightening the top of the shoe to the sole of the shoe (which logically will flatten your feet!). You can see the engineering on the shoe itself, the side strings around the sides of the shoe is where it's at. The support isn't coming from the sole, it's coming from all around the shoe. My feet feel much, much better. There were times where my feet hurt so much that I couldn't walk anymore. That doesn't happen to me now. I'm wondering if wearing these sneakers has reversed any of the problems I've had with my arches (since I used to have pretty good arches) but honestly, I have no interest in going back to the doctor even if only out of spite.This doesn't solve my problem with bad dress shoes. Well, actually, it kind of does. At least my feet are healthy enough to put on dress shoes when I absolutely need to. But the rest of the time, it's Nike Free Run 5.I stick with the all black ones most of the time. I bought the bright yellow pair as well, but I haven't brought myself to wear them much. They're just too garish. I'll probably get them in the more subdued red colors next, but these are likely to be the only sneakers wear from now on.

First off, the quality is great! The SL (synthetic leather) intertwined with the air vents gives really consistent control and feel for the ball during: dribbling, passing, shooting, controlling, etc. The SL provides a good grip to the ball without being to &#34;sticky&#34; on your shots but has enough slickness to do an elastico. Secondly, the shoes look much better in person than in the picture provided. My main reason I was debating to get these shoes or the Nike Gatos was by the way that these looked. In the picture, the air vents look like they were &#34;slapped&#34; unto the SL and they looked too thin from top to bottom making them look kinda feminine. I was so wrong. The air vents were neatly stitched alongside the SL, and the thickness only looks thin when brand new and not yet worn. It breaks into your foot within a few days. Lastly, these shoes fit perfectly but I had to let them break-in for a couple of weeks since I had really wide feet and these shoes run a little thin and long (I would recommend getting a half-size larger for thin-footed people). After this period of time, they fit like a glove; really comfy! To sum things up, the Nike Davinho offers an awesome all-round indoor football shoe that can be bought at an amazing price. You don't even have to use them for football; their antique-ness with a modern twist can be used for a daily walk-around shoe and make you look good!

Solid, dependable, it's been around forever. It just goes to show that the best running shoe is the shoe that fits YOU best. Recently I splurged on a pair of Nike fly-knits. It gets great reviews and it fit me really nicely at first, but after running more than 4 miles in them my ankle started hurting.  I no doubt believe that those who are giving the fly-knit 5 stars are having a great experience. I have learned, and re-learned, though, that for me, nothing beats the Pegasus. It's not a minimalist shoe but it is so soft and has so much padding that I can run forever in these and never feel the pounding. Yes the fly-knit is light as a feather, but I will trade off a little extra weight for a shoe that I can feel and that gives my feet the protection they need. The Nike Vomero is a similar shoe and I recently trained and ran a 1/2 marathon in the Vomero without issues. However, the Pegasus is even more comfortable than the Vomero for me and it is less expensive. I caught a great deal on amazon and got these for $83.49!  I have never been disappointed in the Nike Pegasus- why I waste my money trying the latest craze in running shoe's I don't know. It will be Pegasus forever from now on. I don't know if it's because my meet are a little flat, but I find myself buying the Pegasus and Vomero's a full size and a half larger than my normal shoes and they are very comfortable for me. I know the rule of thumb for running shoes is a 1/2 size bigger only, but you should definitely try these on at a local store and try a few sizes larger before purchasing.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Pegasus forever- I will never stray again", "unixReviewTime": 1391644800, "reviewTime": "02 6, 2014"}

They have been the most comfortable running shoe I've ever used, with the right amount of cushion, but not too heavy.

I am an extreme supinator who prefers a neutral shoe with lots of cushioning throughout. I can't wear any shoe with a dual density sole or motion control. I can tell in short order if I'm wearing the wrong shoe, as my arches will flare up during a walk/run. Generally, with Nike, one must buy a half size larger; this has been my experience, anyway. The Pegasus 30 is true to my normal size (11). The full-length Cushlon is top-shelf and it provides plush cushioning throughout the stride. The upper is breathable and seamless, so there are no painful spots on the top of the foot (or anywhere else). The shoe provides a snug and supportive fit and is light in weight. There is plenty of room in the toe box area, so no pinching. The sole provides excellent grip and contact with paved surfaces. Although I haven't run in wet conditions in this shoe, I am certain that the traction would be excellent. Now, I will provide a short list of other shoes that I have worn/run in for extended periods that I feel the Pegasus is superior to: Asics Kayano 19, Asics Nimbus 14, Brooks Ghost 5, New Balance 990. Of course this is based on my subjectivity, but the Pegasus feels lighter and provides more plush cushioning than any of these shoes. I will also mention that this is my first pair of Pegasus.

Wright \"Reader, Writer, Reviewer\"", "helpful": [25, 25], "reviewText": "As an underpronator, I'm generally told to look for a running shoe that is cushioned, flexible, and has arch support but no stability features. The cushion is to offset the fact that my foot is rather rigid (which is why it doesn't roll in to the neutral position). I need impact to be absorbed, so I don't hurt myself. The flexibility is to encourage my foot to roll inward in much as it is willing to do so. And the arch support reduces the affect of impact on my arch, and as a result helps me avoid plantar fasciitis (which I have suffered from in the past).This shoe meets all the above criteria. Despite being incredibly well cushioned, it somehow also manages to be flexible in the forefoot. The middle section of the shoe wraps my foot snugly, lending arch support. I feel both secure and comfortable in this shoe. Also, this shoe is lighter than some other cushioned shoes I've tried. In short, I love it!Sizing note: My non-running shoes are all 8-8.5. My running shoes are generally size 9. I need a 9.5 in these, to get the roominess that is recommended for when feet swell during running.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great for this medium-arched underpronator", "unixReviewTime": 1381104000, "reviewTime": "10 7, 2013"}

They offer a ton of support for my knees but they aren't clunky and cumbersome.  The colors are super cute!

I have flat feet, or more accurately, flat foot as my right foot is flat but not my left. I began feeling pain in my lateral ankle that only seemed to appear and worsen when I ran. At first I thought I was increasing my mileage or speed too fast and got an overuse injury, but it turns out it was the shoes. Halfway through a particularly painful run I switched my shoes back to my old partially worn out Nike Vomero's and the pain went away instantly and I was able to finish my run. I am hoping to return these as I've only worn this pair for a few miles on the treadmill my other pair got the brunt of the mileage. I have ordered a pair of Nike Pegasus 30's which are like the Vomero's but cheaper- a solid shoe with excellent cushioning which will be better for my type of feet.

Pierce \"rock and/or roller\"", "helpful": [9, 11], "reviewText": "Quick note: the shoes come out of the box a little curved at the toe, like an impotent shoe ready to be broken in, and they kind of remain that way after several runs.  The image above makes the shoe look odd.  This has no effect on my review, or their performance, however.On to the shoe.  I've always like nike free, but went through a falling out with running for a while.  after picking it back up by transition into Barefoot running, Vibrams, then NB Minimus, I bought frees.  Loved 'em, but didn't like how the shoe was shaped like either foot (curving left or right at the toe box).  I got an email from Nike showing the release of the Flyknits, and absolutely had to have them.They took a week or so to get used to: wearing w/o sox is the preferred style, and this allows the elastic opening to chafe the front of my leg, right above the top of the foot.  It went away, and running was never the same.- Shoes are super light and responsive.  I don't HATE thicker more cushioned shoes, but I don't wear them.  I like a more natural feel, and these deliver.  The 7-4mm drop is just the amount of cushioning I could want, and the outsoles are soft and super flexy.- the flyknit material keeps the shoe tight and on your foot, even w/o sox.  No friction, no moving, great ventilation.  Somewhat constrictive, but it feels great.  also keeps a nice, curved shoe that doesn't force your foot in a flat or straight position, and doesn't fight against pronation.- can run with or w/o laces.  I keep em just to maintain that shoe look, rather than skittles colored house slippers, but I haven't adjusted them in months.- if you like minimal, or rather, running on the front of your foot, these may not be the best for you.  they help maintain a good forward/midfoot strike, which I like (and if i wanna switch it up i thrown on my NB minimus road).  the soles are rather wide and long, so there's much more contact, but they're sectioned, allowing more surface area, thus more responsiveness around the whole foot.- not ideal for racing, as the bottoms are a little slick, at least for a track or hardwood surface (my school's gym), but they're great for asphalt and gravel (no annoying rocks stabbing the bottom of your feet).- colors: awesome.  something about the &#34;heat map pattern&#34; that supposed to articulate your foot's pressure/contact points, but I'm not sure about that.  either way, they look super!- price: way too much. I was a bit impulsive by getting these; I was walking by the nike lab in la outside the x-games and had to have em.  but they've proven to be a great investment.  I would do it again.  shoes are hearty, soles are tuff, colors are way out there, lightweight, fast, responsive.  just way groovy shoes.  even good in the rain, despite the lack of traction material.I'm not one to go nuts about reducing shoes and running down to the science, cause it gets us nowhere.  I just happen to find a great pair of shoes at a not-so-great price.  i don't buy into the scientific jargon and rules for running regarding pronation and forefoot/midfoot/barefoot/upsidedown foot blah blah.  I'm 30, and have been running religiously since I joined the Army Infantry in '02, which put my feet through hell, and I've never had a running problem, except when I stopped for a year and picked up smoking.  If you're looking for a new way to run, try these out.  get away from what the fleet feet- ers and the action runners and whomever tell you.  the greatest runners run the way they feel best, not how others tell them to.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Change the Main Image", "unixReviewTime": 1387152000, "reviewTime": "12 16, 2013"}

People seem to mistake the \"Run\" shoe for the \"Moccasin\" and vise versa. Rest assured that these are two completely different shoes under the same good quality brand. I had some Nike Classics that I started using for work and I love them because my feet never hurt when I wear them unlike my actual \"shoes for crews\" working shoes. I know wearing Nike shoes for work is somewhat not a good idea because you want to try to preserve the look of those good quality shoes. The quality of the shoe is what made me come back to Nike for my next pair of working shoes. I recently started working at a veterinary clinic and mostly everyone wears running shoes so they can be comfortable when they work. They need a shoe that will provide them with comfort and flexibility. Wearing running shoes at all times is something most people don't recommend for different reasons but mostly because you wear them out so quick. I still look back at my Nike Classics that I've put through hell at work and they're still holding up well. That made me overlook the whole wear and tear stigma about running shoes. I went ahead and started looking for my next pair of Nike shoes. I went to a few shoe stores to check out what they had and I immediately loved the look of the Nike Solarsoft Run over the Moccasins. I also read that the Moccasins are a little narrow and I have wide feet so those weren't an option. So besides the stylish look that the Run shoe has the way they feel and wear is wonderful. They fit perfect on my feet (12 US) and have a built in insole. The insole is not made out of that fabric type material it has more of like this plastic/rubber feel to it. I think I prefer that style better than the old fashion type of shoe. I don't have to worry about the insole coming off or stinking up because it's well made. If you don't like the feel of the insole you can always add one or use Dr. Scholl insoles. The bottom grip pattern on the Run shoes look really cool and serve a purpose. The uniform squares form a perfect pattern for grip even in wet conditions. When the shoe gets wet the squares give you more grip therefore making the shoe slip resistant. Now I use these for work and I'm always around spills and accidents so I can say that I've tested these shoes thoroughly in wet conditions. As far as comfort these shoes feel great and really give your feet resistance. I haven't used them for running but I have sprinted with them from time to time and I do feel like the heal support is lacking a little. I'm so surprised that this line of shoe isn't very popular I guess it slipped through the cracks since Nike has so many shoes coming out. Their loss is your gain because you can find them at an affordable price at certain retail stores or online. I love wearing these with my scrubs especially since I got them in the royal blue color. They look beautiful and wear just as good as any other high quality Nike shoe.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Running Shoes for Work?!?", "unixReviewTime": 1405123200, "reviewTime": "07 12, 2014"}

I prefer to run on grass mainly and will run on the treadmill a couple of times a week. I have a normal arch and a slight pronation of my left foot. I have had these shoes for over a month now and have logged some miles on them.  The first thing I noticed apart from them looking pretty cool was that there is a support band made out of some sort of plastic glue that holds the upper in place toward the front of the shoe where the laces start. I felt the tightness noticeably when I first put them on and it initially gave me some concern because I do have a wide foot. However that turned out to be a non issue. I still feel it and others who have the shoe express similar sentiments. It does not affect my running in any way and after I've been in the shoes for a bit I don't notice it at allI switched to these shoes after using a much more expensive shoe the Asics gel kinsea. I quit using them after I developed plantar fasciitis. I was seriously disappointed in those shoes. The nike free has been free of pain for me!  I feel comfortable with the shoes and they give me a good feel for the surface and adequate support for my runs. They have a lot of flexibility in them and some may not like that as it may be less stable on uneven surfaces or bumpy roads. For me that is not an issue.

I am a sixty-two year old woman who walks 5-7 miles daily, sometimes a little more and occasionally a little less (if my feet are aching). I tend to get a few more aches and pains than when I was younger and sometimes I get aches and pains in my feet, probably because I walk so much. I have had a few broken bones in my feet and wrists, but no really severe broken bones, so I am not sure if that is a contributing factor, or just that I am getting older and walk so much. Some mornings I do wake up with stiffness in my hands, so I may have some minor arthritis due to having had broken bones in the past. I had been wearing the Merrell Moab shoes, which worked well for a while, though they were heavy. Then, I got a knot on the bottom of my foot in the arch area and also a pain on the top of my foot down the left side. I decided to go back to a lighter pair of shoes. In the past I had worn some very lightweight Merrell running shoes which were very comfortable, but I did tend to get a callous area on the outer edge of one of my feet  on the side where my little toe is. I went to Dick's and saw the Nike Flyknit 4.0 shoes and tried them on and instantly loved them. The knit material on the top of the shoe hugs and conforms to your foot giving support but is not at all constrictive. Nowhere does the shoe rub against the skin so it is a shoe that is not blister causing. The bottom of the shoe is very flexible and bends with your foot but also has very good arch support, or does for my foot anyway. I bought the pair at Dick's and paid $20.00 more for them than these shoes cost. They relieved my foot pain instantly when I started wearing them. After walking about 20 miles in the pair I got from Dick's Sporting Goods, I ordered these from Amazon.com and saved myself $20.00. I figured it would be good to have two pairs. They are so lightweight. It is amazing how much more energy that I have since switching back to a light-weight pair of shoes. I think my foot really benefits from the more flexible sole and my balance also feels better with the lower heel of the shoe. I find that as I am getting older my balance is not as good as my younger years and a lower heeled shoe makes me feel more stable with a better center of balance. So far, these shoes are working great for me. Hope they continue to work well. Will need to look for a warmer version for winter wear though, because the knit material I do not think will be warm enough for winter wear.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "fantastic so far, helped relieve foot pain", "unixReviewTime": 1400112000, "reviewTime": "05 15, 2014"}

Pierce \"rock and/or roller\"", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "These shoes are perfect for the casual runner, that is, one who averages 3 or so miles at a nice jog and isn't overly concerned with pacing and distance.  The gym is a good place, as is cross fit.After my brief love affair with the original Free Flyknit in Rainbow Vomit color scheme, I decided to give the newer, lighter iteration a go.  I used the Free Flyknit 5.0 for a good 6 months, averaging about 4 miles with maximums of 6, at a good pace too (~ 6:45/mile); then I realized that anything further and the shoes began to hold me back, like I was running through mud.I gave these a shot, though, as I wanted a new distance shoe and figured maybe it was just the weirdness of the inaugural shoe.  It wasn't, for me at least.  The same issue persists, even with a revamped sole and upper.  And I think the former is the problem.  i've never felt truly &#34;fast&#34; in any of the frees; maybe the very first ones back in 2003, but I was in the Army then and running a lot against my will.The sole is not a single mass; it's several pods or hexagons that are fused to the insole and allow the shoe to flex with nearly every subtle movement of the foot.  Nike WANTS this to translate to a more natural feel, and yet I think it over exaggerates it.  Whereas some shoes of the same minimalist vain succeed in this area by keeping the sole one whole piece, Nike went a bit too far.  II think what's happening is the sole is allowing impact energy to spread across each individual pod, and when there's more surface area I feel like the shoe begins to work against the runner.  Basically, the pods are too independent and cushy to allow for an optimal strike and return - anything more than 3 miles and I start to feel like I'm running through mud.  This could be such a good shoe if the sole were more, substantial: maybe a bit thinner but stiffer.  The upper is fantastic though.  So, I don't recommend this shoe for anyone who wants to work on speed or distance.

These are quite possibly the most comfortable sneakers I have ever worn.I also am a size 10 and got the size 9.5 which fit perfectly, so they do run about a half inch larger. The last thing you want in a shoe is for your foot to be sliding around in them.They also have micro-sheer fabric that allows your feet to breathe. Especially useful on hot days. Not so much in the winter. Either way, they are still my year-round do-everything sneaker. Worth every penny even though they are made in China and probably cost Nike $10 to make. No one will ever accuse a shoemaker of passing on the savings to the consumer.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Attention all Heel Walkers", "unixReviewTime": 1404518400, "reviewTime": "07 5, 2014"}
